lessfs requires tokyocabinet to be installed on the system.
http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/index.html

On 32bit systems don't forget to configure tokyocabinet with:
./configure --enable-off64 
Failure to do so will limit the databases to a 2GB filesize.

##### WARNING #######

Although tokyocabinet is still required to build lessfs, 
using the database is no longer recommended.
Please consider compiling Lessfs with either 
(stable) --with-berkeleydb or (experimental) --with-hamsterdb

Tokyocabinet can and will corrupt beyond repair when 
the system goes down unexpectedly in case of a power outage 
or crash!
